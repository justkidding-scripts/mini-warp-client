# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## Quick GitHub Upload Steps

### Option 1: Create Repository via GitHub Web Interface (Recommended)
1. Go to https/github.com/FoundationAgents (or your preferred GitHub account)
2. Click "New repository"
3. Repository name: `mini-warp-client`
4. Description: `Advanced WARP Terminal Client - Cybersecurity Research Tool with GUI/CLI modes, modular architecture, and robust shutdown handling`
5. Make it **Public** (for your research visibility)
6. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
7. Click "Create repository"
